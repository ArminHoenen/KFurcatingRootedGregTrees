# KFurcatingRootedGregTrees
This project provides code for computing the numbers of rooted Greg trees with root degree k, as described in the paper mentioned herebelow.
# Usage
<b>Java</b>
1. Create a new Class named "KFurcatingRootedGregTrees" and paste the Java Code there, add package declaration if necessary.
2.a) From here you can use the code in any programming environment such as eclipse, intellJIdea or netBeans etc. if you change  
     comment out line 37 and comment in line 36, where you can set your maximum m for which you want a result. 
2.b) Compile once and the Export as "runnable jar" under any name, for instance "kfurcs.jar"
3. Use java -jar kfurcs.jar m
where m must be a positive Integer which is the maximum m for which you want a result.
