# KFurcatingRootedGregTrees
This project provides code for computing the numbers of rooted Greg trees with root degree k, as described in the paper mentioned herebelow.
# Usage
<b>Java</b>
- Create a new Class named "KFurcatingRootedGregTrees" and paste the Java Code there, add package declaration if necessary.<br/>
- From here you can use the code in any programming environment such as eclipse, intellJIdea or netBeans etc. If you change  
     the maxlim variable in line 34 you can set your individual maximum m until which you want a result. 

<b>OR</b> Use the runnable jar "kfurc.jar" by commadnline call: "java -jar kfurc.jar <i>m</i>"<br/>
where <i>m</i> must be a positive Integer which is the maximum <i>m</i> for which you want a result.<br/>
<b>Python</b>
